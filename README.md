Starbucks Local

A simple Angular app which connects with the Google Maps Javascript API (Places Library) to grab specific data about a business. If you scaled it you would add all the other APIs from social media and use the template to make calls for all specific Starbucks locations.

Instructions:

1 - Make sure node is installed
2 - Do an npm install within the repo
3 - Do a bower install
4 - Make sure gulp is installed

Type 'gulp' to start the server
